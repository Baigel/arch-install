tl;dr go find an actual guide - this stuff mostly specific to how I setup my working environment

Please don't use these as a guide. They are just a few notes that I have taken while running a couple of different Linux distributions. I find it is easier to reproduce stuff that I have done in Linux when I write it down and this is the where I do just that.
