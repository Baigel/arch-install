Still Need to Fix:
	 - Correct Login Screen at Boot
	 - Screen Flashes session when waking up from sleep
	 - Computer Crashes when rebooting
	 - PC takes long time to shutdown or boot
	 - Please find a better way to disable numlock (see macros section)


Arch Linux KDE Plasma 5 Customization Document:

Install Arch Linux and Plasma 5:
	Arch Linux Install:   https://linoxide.com/distros/beginners-arch-linux-installation-guide/
	Plasma 5 Install and configure:     https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=160&v=lv5CyzsIjJk

	Basic Arch Linux Install Commands:
		 - Access the wifi by using "ip link" to find interface name, and "wifi-menu -o [interfaceName]" to connect to wifi
			 - Note: During and after Arch installation, use "pacman -S iw wpa_supplicant dialog wpa_actiond" to install required wifi packages (don't do this yet)
		 - Set system time: "timedatectl set-ntp true" (Check using "timedatectl status")
		 - Prepare the Disk
			 - Make correct partitions using "cfdisk /dev/sda" (Make a swap partition [type 82] and a system partition [type 83], and type "yes" under the write tab to save changes)
			 - Toggle sda1 as bootable by selecting the "Bootable" tab.
			 - Make both partions ext4 file system using the command "mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdaX"
				 - Mount the partitions using these commands and make swap files (assumes sda1 is system and sda2 is swap)
				 - "mount /dev/sda1 /mnt"
				 - "mkswap /dev/sda2"
				 - "swapon /dev/sda2"
		 - Install Arch linux base system:
			 - Backup the mirrors: "cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup" (Note: this clears the original mirrorslist file),
				rank the mirrors in order from fastest to slowest: "rankmirrors -n 6 /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup > /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist" (NOTE: THE ABOVE 
				COMMAND REQUIRES 'pacman-contrib' TO BE INSTALLED. INSTEAD OF THAT MANUALLY UNCOMMENT GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTANT SERVERS ("nano /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist"))
			 - Install Arch: "pacstrap /mnt base base-devel"
		 - Generate the fstab file: "genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab", "cat /mnt/etc/fstab" (the last command is just a way of checking it worked)
		 - Change the root system: "arch-chroot /mnt" (At this point, you can install wifi drivers)
		 - Change the system time: "ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Australia/Brisbane /etc/localtime", then "hwclock --systohc"
		 - Configure the host: "echo archlinux > /etc/hostname", then "nano /etc/hosts" and add "#<ip-address>	<localhost.domain.org>	<hostname>"
													"127.0.0.1	localhost.localdomain	localhost"
													"::1		localhost.localdomain	localhost"
													"127.0.1.1	archlinux.localdomain	archlinux"
		 - Add a new user: "useradd -m -G wheel,users -s /bin/bash [username]" (then use "passwd" and "passwd [username]" to change password of root and [username] respectively)
			 - "nano /etc/sudoers" and add "[username] ALL=(ALL) ALL" underneath "root ALL=(ALL) ALL"
		 - Configure network dynamically: "systemctl enable dhcpcd" (This can cause issues later and may need to be disabled later - see issues section for details)
		 - Install Grub bootloader: "pacman -S grub os-prober", then "grub-install --recheck --target=i386-pc /dev/sdX", then "grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg"
		 - Exit and Quit: "exit", then "umount -R /mnt", then "reboot"

	Basic KDE Plasma 5 Install Commands: (after installing arch, it may be nessacary to "sudo systemctl disable dhcpcd" to let wifi work - run "sudo wifi-menu -o [networkinterface]")
		 - Install Packages: "sudo pacman -S xorg xorg-xinit"
		 - Create X initiation file: "echo "exec startkde" > ~/.xinitrc"
		 - Install Plasma Desktop: "sudo pacman -S plasma-desktop"
		 - Install a desktop manager: "sudo pacman -S sddm", and enable using "sudo systemctl enable sddm.service"
		 - (Optionally install some other nice programs: "sudo pacman -S konsole dolphin chromium kate")

Things done after installation:
	 - Connect to internet
	 - Corrected the system time
	 - Installed (if not already installed): dolphin, konsole, chrome, kate
	 - Configured Raid1 and Backups:
		 - Install 'lvm' for Raid 1 (see below), and setup 'LaptopFiles' Backup, and 'GDrive' Backup
			 - Create Physical Volumes: "sudo pvcreate /dev/sdXX /dev/sdXX" (add "-ff" if problems encountered)
				 - In the case of LaptopFiles Backup: "sudo pvcreate /dev/sda3 /dev/sdb2"
				 - In the case of GDrive Backup: "sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1"
			 - Create Volume Group: "sudo vgcreate VolGroup00 /dev/sdXX /dev/sdXX"
				 - In the case off LaptopFiles Backup: "sudo vgcreate Backups /dev/sda3 /dev/sdb2"
				 - In the case off GDrive Backup: "sudo vgcreate Backups /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1"
			 - Create Logical Volumes: "lvcreate --type RaidLevel [OPTIONS] -n Name -L Size VG [PVs]"
				 - This will usually look something like this:
					 - "sudo lvcreate --type raid1 --mirrors 1 --activate ay -autobackup y --permissions rw --persistent y --minor 4 -L XXXG -n Name VolGroup00 /dev/sdXX /dev/sdXX"
					 - In the case of LaptopFiles Backup: "sudo lvcreate --type raid1 --mirrors 1 --activate ay -autobackup y --permissions rw --persistent y --minor 4 -L 74.45G -n LaptopFiles Backups /dev/sda3 /dev/sdb2"
					 - In the case of GDrive Backup: "sudo lvcreate --type raid1 --mirrors 1 --activate ay -autobackup y --permissions rw --persistent y --minor 4 -L 111.8G -n GDrive Backups /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1"
			 - Create Filesystem: "sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/VolGroup00/Name" and then "df -h /dev/VolGroup00/Name"
				 - In the case of LaptopFiles Backup: "sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/Backups/LaptopFiles" and then "df -h /dev/Backups/LaptopFiles"
				 - In the case of GDrive Backup: "sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/Backups/GDrive" and then "df -h /dev/Backups/GDrive"
			 - Make Directories: "sudo mkdir -p /VolGroup00/Name"
				 - In the case of LaptopFiles Backup: "sudo mkdir -p /Backups/LaptopFiles"
				 - In the case of GDrive Backup: "sudo mkdir -p /Backups/GDrive"
			 - Mount Filesystem: "sudo mount /dev/VolGroup00/Name /VolGroup00/Name"
				 - In the case of LaptopFiles Backup: "sudo mount /dev/Backups/LaptopFiles /Backups/LaptopFiles"
				 - In the case of GDrive Backup: "sudo mount /dev/Backups/GDrive /Backups/GDrive"
			 - Add all drives to the fstab file:
				 - "sudo nano /etc/fstab"
				 - "/dev/Name   /VolGroup00/Name      ext4    defaults        0       2"
					 - In the case of LaptopFiles Backup: "/dev/Backups/LaptopFiles   /Backups/LaptopFiles      ext4    defaults        0       2"
					 - In the case of GDrive Backup: "/dev/Backups/GDrive   /Backups/GDrive      ext4    defaults        0       2"
			 - Make Drives read/write without root: "sudo chmod 777 /VolGroup/Name"
				- In the case of LaptopFiles Backup: "sudo chmod 777 /Backups/LaptopFiles"
				- In the case of GDrive Backup: "sudo chmod 777 /Backups/GDrive"
			 - Check sync/copy status and other stuff: "sudo lvs"
		 - Make the 'LaptopFiles' Drive Network Available

Printer and Scanner Stuff:
     - Installing Brother HL-2132 Driver:
     - Download the ppd file from online (ppd's are os independent - so don't bother search for an arch/manjaro specific one)
     - Use the downloaded ppd file when installing driver through cups.
     - Previously, the ppd file for HL-2135 has worked - downloaded from openprinting.org
     - If you have the issue 'waiting for printer to become active'
            - "cat > /etc/udev/rules.d/10-usbprinterrules"
            - "sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/10-usbprinterrules"
            - put " ATTR{idvendor}=="ID_VENDOR_HERE", ATTR{idProduct}=="ID_PRODUCT_HERE", MODE:="0660", GROUP:="lp", ENV{libsane_matched}:="yes" " into the file (make sure to adjust idvendor and idProduct to that of the printer - find values using lsusb)
            - For the Brother HL-2130, the idvendor is "04f9" and the idProduct is "003f".
