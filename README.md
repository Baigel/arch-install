# Arch Install
Here is a collection of things that I have developed for Arch Linux (and Arch Linux based distros). I have also included links to some of the resources that I use.

## In This Repository
 - Linux install notes (would not recommend them as an actual guide, but have included a list of problems/solutions that I have come across; might come in useful)
 - Linux install script (created with help from the resources below)

## Still To Add
 - unzip (extra)
 - opencv
 - cmake
 - Espanso (text expander) (should also add config to dotfiles repo)
 - Fix Buzzing sounds ([Load Buzzing Sound and No sound when screen turns](Arch_Install_Fix_Notes/Load Buzzing Sound and No sound when screen turns.md))
 - Fix Monitor Hotplugging ([Monitor Hotplugging](Arch_Install_Fix_Notes/Monitor Hotplugging.md))
 - [USB Handling](Arch_Install_Fix_Notes/USB Handling.md)

 - Add `lxsession` (polkit needed for elevated privilages)

 - Add colour theming to terminal (specifically when running `pacman`, `nano`, `yay`)
 - Remove kvantum-qt5 if not already done so
 - Add `nm-connection-editor` to install programs
 - Should have a flag for necessary programs/good to have/nice to have programs
- Espanso (nice to have)
- CopyQ (nice to have) (or other clipboard manager)
- Add `nerd-fonts` package to termina stuff (necessary for p10k to work fully)
- Add `zsh-autosuggestions` to terminal stuff
- Add `lxinput` for keyboard/mouse settings
- `i3lock` command for locking is `i3lock -i ~/.lockscreen_wallpaper`
