# Arch Install
Here is a collection of things that I have developed for Arch Linux (and Arch Linux based distros). I have also included links to some of the resources that I use.

# In this Repository
 - Linux install notes (would not recommend them as an actual guide, but have included a list of problems/solutions that I have come across; might come in useful)
 - Linux install script (created with help from the resources below)

# Other Resources
Here are some links to resources that I have found useful:
 - Arch Wiki Installation Guide (obviously): https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide
 - Disconnected Custom Install Script: https://disconnected.systems/blog/archlinux-installer/#the-complete-installer-script
